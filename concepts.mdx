## What is Confidential Computing?

Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computations in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This technology provides a level of assurance and verification that is impossible to achieve with traditional cloud computing.

## Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

TEEs are hardware security features that create hardware-level isolation for programs. They provide:

## How Tinfoil Uses TEEs

Tinfoil leverages TEEs to provide three core security guarantees:

### 1. Confidentiality

<Note>
Your data stays encrypted end-to-end using hardware-level safeguards and is never accessible to anyone other than you â€” not even to Tinfoil.
</Note>

- Data remains encrypted in memory
- Hardware-enforced isolation from other processes
- Protected from cloud provider access
- Secure from administrative access

### 2. Integrity

The integrity of your workloads is guaranteed through:

<Steps>
  1. **Hardware Verification** - Prove authenticity of NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD hardware
  2. **Configuration Validation** - Verify proper security settings
  3. **Code Measurement** - Unique identification of running code
  4. **Automatic Attestation** - Real-time verification by user devices
</Steps>

### 3. Transparency

Tinfoil provides verifiable code execution:

- Source code published on GitHub
- Automatic compilation through GitHub Actions
- Cryptographic measurements logged with Sigstore
- Real-time verification of running code
- Public audit trail of all deployments

## Comparison with Traditional Cloud

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Cloud" icon="cloud">
    - Relies on virtualization
    - Provider has workload visibility
    - Trust-based security model
    - Limited verification capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tinfoil Enclaves" icon="shield">
    - Hardware-level isolation
    - Zero visibility into workloads
    - Verifiable security model
    - Cryptographic attestation
