## What is Tinfoil?

Tinfoil enables you to run AI workloads with the security of on-prem infrastructure and the convenience of cloud â€” backed by hardware-enforced confidential computing.

By using Tinfoil enclaves, you can:
- Run AI workloads with complete data privacy through hardware-level safeguards
- Let users cryptographically verify the code running in the secure enclave
- Deploy with cloud convenience while maintaining on-prem level security
- Gain insights while maintaining end-to-end privacy

## Key Features

### Hardware-Backed Security

While standard cloud providers rely on virtualization that allows them visibility into your workloads, Tinfoil's enclaves create true hardware-level isolation. Your users' private data remains protected not only from the cloud provider but also from intermediate services and even your own organization.

### Verifiable Privacy

Users can verify runtime attestation in real-time and confirm their data remains private:

<Steps>
  1. Code integrity is verified against public GitHub repositories
  2. Enclave attestation confirms secure hardware configuration
  3. Binary verification ensures code matches transparency logs
</Steps>

### Cloud-Native Deployment

Get the best of both worlds:
- Deploy with the ease of cloud infrastructure
- Maintain complete control over your data
- Prevent vendor lock-in
- Scale seamlessly while maintaining security

### Near-Native Performance

Powered by NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures, Tinfoil delivers:
- Near-identical performance to unencrypted workloads
- Support for large AI models
- Hardware-accelerated encryption
- Minimal overhead for secure operations
